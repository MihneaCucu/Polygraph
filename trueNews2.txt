The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Thursday that global life expectancy has increased by more than six years since the year 2000, largely due to advances in medical technology, improved access to clean water, and expanded vaccination programs. According to the WHO’s 2024 Global Health Report, the average life expectancy worldwide is now 73.4 years, up from 67.2 years at the turn of the millennium.
Dr. Maria Neira, Director of the Department of Public Health and Environment at WHO, stated, “This progress is a testament to the collaborative efforts of governments, healthcare professionals, and communities around the world. Investments in primary healthcare, disease prevention, and health education have saved millions of lives.”
The report highlights that the most significant gains were seen in low- and middle-income countries, where child mortality rates have dropped by more than 50% and deaths from infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS have declined sharply. The expansion of immunization programs has played a crucial role, with over 90% of children worldwide now receiving basic vaccines.
In addition to medical advances, improvements in sanitation and access to clean drinking water have contributed to better health outcomes. The United Nations reports that 2.6 billion people have gained access to improved water sources since 2000, reducing the incidence of waterborne diseases.
Despite these achievements, the WHO cautions that challenges remain. Non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer are now the leading causes of death globally. The organization calls for continued investment in health systems, research, and policies that address the social determinants of health.
The WHO’s findings are based on data collected from national health ministries, peer-reviewed studies, and international organizations. The full report is available on the WHO website.
